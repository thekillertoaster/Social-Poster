## Quick Start
1. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx playwright install
   ```
   
2. Build
   ```bash
   npm run build
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/*/*" \
   TIKTOK_USERNAMES="nba,shattereddawnpve" \
   npm start
   ```

## How It Works

- Scrape latest videos: Uses Playwright + headless Chromium to open each profile page and collect video links and thumbnails.
- De-dupe: Keeps a set of already-forwarded video IDs per username in the state file.
- Embed to Discord: Builds a safe, size-bounded embed (title, description, thumbnail, url) and POSTs it to your webhook.
- Loop: Runs once on startup, then repeats every POLL_MINUTES.

### State file structure:
```json
{
  "nba": ["7345678901234567890", "7345678901234567891"],
  "shattereddawnpve": ["7333333333333333333"]
}
```
*You can safely delete this file to ‚Äúresync‚Äù (it will re-forward whatever the script sees next as new).*
